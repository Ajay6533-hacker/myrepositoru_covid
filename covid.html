            <h3>Coronaviruses(Covid-19,2020)</h3>
            <p> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
                Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without
                special treatment.

                Coronaviruses are large group of viruses that cause illness in humans and animals. Rarely, animal
                coronaviruses can
                evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with MERS and SARS.

                Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the severe acute respiratory
                syndrome coronavirus
                (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused more than 10,000
                cumulative cases in
                the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV.

About COVID-19
PrintPDF
Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe
diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel
coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that
SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known
coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.

Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In
more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing
and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness
such as coughing and sneezing. -->

    What are dangerous of coronavirus
Coronaviruses are large group of viruses that cause illness in humans and animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can
evolve and infect people and then spread between people such as has been seen with MERS and SARS.

Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the epidemics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused more than 10,000 cumulative cases in
the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV. -->


<!-- Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
HOW IT SPREADS
The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes,
or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by
touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. -->
